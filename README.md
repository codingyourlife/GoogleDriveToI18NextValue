#  GoogleDriveToI18NextValue

The idea: Export Google Doc as Markdown (Add-on Docs to Markdown). Then paste the Markdown on the left side and export as single-line HTML that can be used as translationKey in i18next.

This is repo was forked because original did not have single line option. Also span tags remained as leftovers.
